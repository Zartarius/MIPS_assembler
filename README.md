# MIPS_interpreter
A very basic MIPS 'interpreter' written primarily in Python. I don't plan on making it have full functionality, this project is mainly for my own learning of both Python and MIPS. Thus functionalities such as error checking will be limited. To use the program, run `main.py` and add the name of the assembly file as a command line argument (e.g. `python3 main.py test.s`).

**Project currently under progress**


# Files

`main.py` - The central file, calls the internal and external functions. 

`test.s` - An assembly file to test the program.
